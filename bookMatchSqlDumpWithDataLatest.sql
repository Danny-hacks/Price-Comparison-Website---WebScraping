As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn\'t believe in lasting romantic relationships but her best friend does, and that\'s what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive on her way to a happily ever after was always going to be tough, scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting woman, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when he agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion.

He gains a new lease on life, though, when he falls for the young and gorgeous Angiolina-except that his angel just happens to be an unapologetic cheat. But what begins as a comedy of infatuated misunderstanding ends in tragedy, as Emilio\'s jealous persistence in his folly-against his friends\' and devoted sister\'s advice, and even his own best knowledge-leads to the loss of the one person who, too late, he realizes he truly loves. Marked by deep humanity and earthy humor, by psychological insight and an elegant simplicity of style, As a Man Grows Older (Senilità, in Italian; the English title was the suggestion of Svevo\'s great friend and admirer, James Joyce) is a brilliant study of hopeless love and hapless indecision. It is a masterwork of Italian literature, here beautifully rendered into English in Beryl de Zoete\'s classic translation.', '2024-07-08'),

Now the prodigal hottie has returned to their small town. When Hallie is hired to revamp the gardens on the Vos estate, she wonders if she\'ll finally get that smooch. But the grumpy professor isn\'t the teenager she remembers and their polar opposite personalities clash spectacularly. One wine-fueled girls\' night later, Hallie can\'t shake the sense that she did something reckless-and then she remembers the drunken secret admirer letter she left for Julian. Oh shit.On sabbatical from his ivy league job, Julian plans write a novel. But having Hallie gardening right outside his window is the ultimate distraction. She\'s eccentric, chronically late, often literally covered in dirt-and so unbelievably beautiful, he can\'t focus on anything else. Until he finds an anonymous letter sent by a woman from his past. Even as Julian wonders about this admirer, he\'s sucked further into Hallie\'s orbit. Like the flowers she plants all over town, Hallie is a burst of color in Julian\'s gray-scale life.
